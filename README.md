# airbnb-clone-project

The Airbnb Clone Project Blueprint is a clone of the AirBnB website, focusing on the backend structure. It is a learning project to understand backend development. It is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments.

## Goals

Recreate core functionalities of AirBnB, which includes:

- **User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration,
- **Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- **Booking System**: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.

## Technology Stack

This project utilizes a modern and powerful technology stack to build a robust and scalable Airbnb clone:

- **Python**: The core programming language used to develop the backend logic and server-side functionality.

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that simplifies the creation of complex, secure, and maintainable web applications. It’s used for handling URL routing, views, models, and admin interfaces.

- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: An extension of Django that provides tools and libraries to build and manage RESTful APIs. It handles authentication, serialization, and response formatting.

- **PostgreSQL**: A reliable and powerful open-source relational database system used to store and manage structured data for the application.

- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that enables clients to request only the data they need. It provides flexibility and efficiency in data retrieval, especially useful in complex frontends.

- **Git/GitHub**: Used for version control and collaboration. Git tracks changes in the source code, while GitHub hosts the project repository and facilitates team collaboration.
